# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add any missing details to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Confirm that this repo is a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Repo checklist

- [ ] Modify the [Overview](#overview) section of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevant documentation and any other criteria/details that the auditors should keep in mind when reviewing. (Here are two well-constructed examples: [Ajna Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna) and [Maia DAO Ecosystem](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia))
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Review and confirm the details created by the Scout (technical reviewer) who was assigned to your contest. *Note: any files not listed as "in scope" will be considered out of scope for the purposes of judging, even if the file will be part of the deployed contracts.*

**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-04-kinetiq/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

1. Some of the sanity checks and rules around the validator slashing mechanisms are assumptions based upon our current understanding
1. The `generatePerformance` function is a sanity check and is unrelated to rewards or funds, we understand it has complex logic but would encourage auditors not to spend too much time on this function

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

As a liquid staking protocol, our primary invariant is that 1 kHYPE === 1 HYPE



‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
future upgradeability as hyperliquid is known to change things quickly and without notice, recovery from a compromised contract

we also have some off chain components that help maintain protocol
