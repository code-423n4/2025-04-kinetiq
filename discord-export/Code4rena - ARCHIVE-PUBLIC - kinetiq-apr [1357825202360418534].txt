# Off-Chain Components Interacting with Kinetiq Protocol
Based on the contract architecture and implementation, here are the key off-chain components that interact with the Kinetiq protocol:
## 1. Oracle Adapters
Purpose: Provide external validator performance data to the protocol
Interactions:
* Connect to external data sources to gather validator metrics
* Implement the IOracleAdapter interface
* Return performance metrics when called by OracleManager.generatePerformance()
* Provide data on validator balance, uptime, speed, integrity, and self-stake
* Track accumulated rewards and slashing amounts
Flow:
`External Data Sources → Oracle Adapters → OracleManager → ValidatorManager`

## 2. Validator Sanity Checker
Purpose: Validate oracle reports for suspicious or malicious data
Interactions:
* Implements the IValidatorSanityChecker interface
* Called by OracleManager to verify validator metrics
* Applies business logic to detect anomalies in validator behavior
* Returns validation results to prevent malicious data from entering the system

## 3. L1 Write Interface
Purpose: Bridge between Ethereum and Hyperliquid for staking operations
Interactions:
* Receives operation requests from StakingManager
* Executes deposit and withdrawal operations on Hyperliquid L1
* Handles validator delegation on L1
* Processes rebalancing operations between validators
* Reports back operation results to the protocol
Flow:
`StakingManager → L1 Write Interface → Hyperliquid L1`


[04/07/2025 23:50] shawn0245
## 4. Operator Service
Purpose: Executes operational tasks requiring active monitoring
Interactions:
* Calls StakingManager.executeL1Operations() to process queued operations
* Triggers OracleManager.generatePerformance() to update validator metrics
* Monitors validator performance and initiates rebalancing when needed
* Requires OPERATOR_ROLE permissions across contracts

## 5. Monitoring & Alerting System
Purpose: Monitors protocol health and alerts on anomalies
Interactions:
* Watches for events emitted by protocol contracts
* Monitors validator performance metrics
* Alerts on suspicious activities or performance degradation
* Tracks exchange ratio changes and liquidity metrics
* May have SENTINEL_ROLE permissions to take emergency actions

## 6. User Interface / dApp
Purpose: Provides user access to protocol functions
Interactions:
* Connects users to staking and withdrawal functions
* Displays protocol metrics and user balances
* Shows validator performance and selection options
* Facilitates user operations through web interface
* Interacts primarily with StakingManager for user operations

## 7. Governance System
Purpose: Manages protocol parameters and upgrades
Interactions:
* Proposes and executes parameter changes
* Manages role assignments across contracts
* Coordinates protocol upgrades
* May implement timelock mechanisms for sensitive changes
* Likely holds DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE across contracts(multisig)

Hi sponsors @Justin | Kinetiq @sha3ns , how many decimals is Hype token in?


[04/08/2025 13:53] shawn0245
Hi @0xgremlincat auditor, decimals differ between HyperCore and HyperEVM. 
HyperEVM uses 18 decimals, 
HyperCore uses 8. 
When L1Write on HyperEVM recognizes only 8 decimals, we’ll need to apply a decimal conversion on that.

make it clear again, 

all exported/public methods except functions like `withdrawFromSpot` & `withdrawTokenFromSpot` , which directly interact with L1Write, are aligned into decimal 18
all amount values except L1Write will align to decimal 18 including oracle.

**1)** what's the practical relationship between StakingManager and validators? (it seems like SM is delegated to only one validator)
But at the same time, it manages operations for multiple validators. Is it in the case where the SM change delegation?
**2) **So I suppose there must be multiple SM contracts. Who operate those? Validators to allow stakers to delegate to them through the SM?


[04/09/2025 19:56] jorgemasvidal
Hello, i have some questions:
1) I see that L1Write.sol and the offchain Operator are out of scope, does this mean that a vulnerability that drains the L1 "pool" is out of scope?
2) I see no tests regarding the withdrawal where there is an `operator` that calls processL1Operations, as described in the docs, that takes the HYPE from the L1 to the StakingManager. Instead, the HYPE is manually `deal`ed to the StakingManager. How can we test the Operator-L1 withdrawal process then? I'm new to this so sorry if i am mistaken.


[04/09/2025 22:00] kyosi2963
Can we get access or some form of docs what these l1Write methods used in the StakingManager do ?


[04/10/2025 02:11] harry_cryptodev
what does L1Write contract do?
Only emit events?


[04/10/2025 02:13] shawn0245
yeah. pretty that much, the system contract connect between L1 and HyperEVM


[04/10/2025 02:14] harry_cryptodev

1. That's unlikely to occur. We have robust sanity checks in place to ensure performance remains within a reasonable range (e.g., APY). Additionally, the entire solution operates under a non-custodial strategy, which further mitigates potential risks.

2. The processL1Operations function handles pre-defined operations queued earlier in the protocol. We’re planning to expand test cases to improve coverage and ensure greater reliability.

StakingManager and validators have a one-to-many relationship. By default, a user delegates to one validator, but assets can potentially be delegated to multiple validators through rebalancing.

> 2) So I suppose there must be multiple SM contracts. Who operate those? Validators to allow stakers to delegate to them through the SM?
Validator owners will maintain their own SM. Validators will welcome users to delegate through the protocol, boosted by a higher APY and benefits, including MEV, point programs, etc.

[04/10/2025 09:38] infectedfuture
thanks, this helps a lot
regarding (1) though: 
if theres a 1-to-many relationship between SM and validators, how is that the mapping `delegations[StakingManager]` (located in `ValidatorManager`) only stores 1 validator for a SM at a time?


[04/10/2025 10:30] nadir_khan_sec
Because there is only 1 SM owner (validator) at a time, i believe

{Reactions}
✅ 

[04/10/2025 12:48] infectedfuture
yeah, that how I see it. 
1 SM can only be delegated to 1 validator (as shown by the mapping), but 1 validator can have multiple SM delegated to it.
But still this don't answer to my question: then why 1 SM can queue operations (withdrawal/deposits) to any validator (e.g `queueL1Operations`)


[04/10/2025 12:50] shawn0245
right, We'll expose one delegate target at a time, without tracking all on-chain, using a more sophisticated algorithm off-chain to calculate the score and select the target delegation.


[04/10/2025 12:53] shawn0245
because we are just make it loose in rebalancing operation, even though we can queue operations to any validator, but its only withdrawal, stake must be a active validator

[04/11/2025 07:33] shawn0245
atm there will be one, but also support multiple stakingManager to link to one token like a potential scale, so its many to one relation


[04/11/2025 07:37] shawn0245
basically we will deploy one stakingManager and one token for retail users, but it also possible we can switch stakingManager from A to B, by separate open & close deposit-pause and withdrawal-pause. when both of them link to one token

Hello, Im not sure If I follow this, because as far as I understand the rebalancing withdraws from multiple validators the SM has delegated to and then redelegates it to the current validator that the SM is mapped to in ValidatorManager? 
Do you mean when we change the delegation address for a SM and then delegate to the new validator via rebalancing?

[04/12/2025 16:51] lucky2892000
@sha3ns , i have seen this in the readme 
As a liquid staking protocol, our primary invariant is that 1 kHYPE === 1 HYPE

this will be only at initial right , before we withdraw any rewards that was earned by validators 

if the rewards increases then the price of kHYPE will always be slightly higher than the HYPE right ?

{Reactions}

[04/12/2025 20:48] georgefalcon_
when there's also a slashing event, the price of Khype would be slightly higher than Hype


[04/13/2025 03:57] lucky2892000
Higher ? , I was thinking it would be lower right ?

If there is slashing then HYPE staked by user which we staked with the validator will be decreased 

decrease in deposit stake will decrease the kHYPE right?

@sha3ns ,  when you are checking the total supply we were looping through and calculating the total supply of  StakingAccountant::_uniqueTokens , if there is one , then looping is not needed , can i know the purpose of this ?


[04/13/2025 09:06] yeahchibyke
Hi sponsors @Justin | Kinetiq @sha3ns ... pardon me if this question is either stupid(very likely) or has been answered. 
But, is there any particular reason why the KHYPE token contract is upgradeable? Especially when it has a pause functionality?


[04/13/2025 09:42] sulaimon3546
Are you working with the 8 decimal or 18 decimals hype

[04/13/2025 11:35] 0xg03.14
I'm really confused about spot, stake. And when sendTokenDelegate(true), will the funds move from delegated to stake balance or transferred to staking manager directly...? @sha3ns or anyone ..?


[04/13/2025 11:35] shawn0245
right, ratio will be decreased when there is a slashing


[04/13/2025 11:36] shawn0245
you may need to try yourself out on Hyperliquid, thats the core difference between EVM(Ethereum) and HyperEVM

what is `HYPE_TOKEN_ID` in SM contract?


[04/13/2025 19:54] 0xmsf14
can we get the implementation of the L1write contract, not just the interface, I'd like to know how L1write.sendCDeposit differs from L1write.sendTokenDelegate


[04/13/2025 20:06] infectedfuture
That is the actual implementation. The contract emits events which are then processed by the nodes on the HyperCore (L1) side
`sendCDeposit` move the tokens from the "spot" balance (which is the L1 balance) to "staking" balance (still on L1)
`sendTokenDelegate` (un)delegate the "staking" balance from/to an operator depending on the boolean parameter

[04/13/2025 20:23] 0xmsf14
Also since the stakingManager can only distribute stake to one Validator at a time, when does the one-to-many other validator come in, will it be changed manually from the validatorManager ?


[04/13/2025 20:28] infectedfuture
from what I've understood, the SM only allow delegation to one validator at time (at least in the standard process, for users mostly)
But there are 2 cases where some stake can be in others validators:

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/13/2025 20:29] infectedfuture
- if the SM changes for a new validator to delegate to. It may still have delegations in other validators. So, there should be a way to withdraw from those and redelegate to the new selected validator (this goes through `VM::rebalanceWithdrawal` and `VM::closeRebalanceRequests`

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/13/2025 20:30] infectedfuture
- Or maybe the admins wants to diversify how are distributed the delegated tokens, and then decide to undelegate some amount from the main operator and delegate to secondary operators (which seems possible through `SM::queueL1Operations`)


[04/13/2025 20:31] infectedfuture
Not sure about the second one though


[04/14/2025 01:37] sepyke
Yup. Looks like the official Hyper docs just give the interface and emitted events too: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/interacting-with-hypercore

[04/14/2025 01:46] sepyke
that's basically the token ID on the HyperCore chain. HyperCore and HyperEVM let you link an asset (but just on testnet for now CMIIW)

@sha3ns since the HL validator clients are not open sourced atm, do we consider MEV within the scope while auditing or not? Thank you.


[04/14/2025 09:48] riceee8969
I think its mostly just to rebalance the emergency withdrawals, but yeah what u stated is indeed possible


[04/14/2025 12:00] pfapostol
Could we assume that the same roles in different contracts belong to the same account?
For example, `OracleManager.MANAGER_ROLE` and `StakingManager.MANAGER_ROLE` are the same account? Or is the names just a bit misleading?


[04/14/2025 12:11] tough111
It doesn't stake as much as allocated to the buffer, so there is no reward?

The rewards change the ratio of the Hype to kHype token, so when withdrawing users will get more Hype. I think that this is the reward they get

{Reactions}
👍 thankyou 

[04/15/2025 09:29] riceee8969
Sorry I don’t follow this. Isn’t it happening via the exchange ratio of the tokens? As the above text says


[04/15/2025 10:21] welith
I don't think you have separate rewards. You delegate your HYPE to validators, and based on their actions, you will either get more (if they get rewarded) or lose (if they get slashed). It is like a vault, where kHype are the shares. The shares rise in value when the validators get rewarded and fall in value when they are slashed.

The judge will determine validity and severity of the issue once they review. If it's downgraded and noted as a valid/sufficient medium, you would be awarded. There's more info [on our awarding process](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/awarding-process#awarding-process) in our docs 🙂

[04/26/2025 08:26] chibibridge
Some input
- F-245 and S-28 is not duplicate; hypercore does not allow queueing withdrawals (cWithdraw == staking -> spot transfer) more than 5 at a time per address, which generates different type of DoS
- S-95 and possibly others shows that DoS occurs even if batchSize is small because `delete` is costly

I really dont like the condition about having SR role for disputing  ur submissions, i would understand if there were comments of judges explaining why submissions are invalid or insufficient but some of them are empty and u should guess. Moreover judge are prone to make mistakes, there can be a moment when an experienced auditor first time participates in contest, judge makes mistakes and marks invalid (for example), however participant do not have right to leave comment

that means the bug severity is low (downgrade)


[04/27/2025 09:06] knight18695
Enforcing POC for those with signal less than 0.6 that  I understand 
Penalising folks who consistently submit spam report That I also get 
But shutting the door to escalate and appeal to the judge for an issue you feel was wrongly marked that sound so unfair and out of it to me 🥲 🥲 And I so question the logic behind this

By the comment on my report I can clearly say the judge have not read the full report..


[04/27/2025 09:39] jorgemasvidal
not my findings, but just curious, how come S-176 (invalid) is not the exact same as F-278 (high valid)


[04/27/2025 13:47] mrudenko
I have the same questions, lol😂


[04/27/2025 14:34] rouhsamad
I think both are invalid, balance of staking manager is increased internally, not by transferring native tokens to it through a transaction, so receive function is not called in this case

This is what i read in hyperliquid discord channel


[04/27/2025 14:47] mrudenko
Staking Manager is contract on EVM. Its balance can be increased only with `receive` of with `stake` function
Another way to send money to smart contract via selfdestruct - which is not related anymore. How balance of this smart contract can be increased more?


[04/27/2025 14:57] rouhsamad
I mean when transferring assets from HyperliquidCore to HyperliquidEVM, the "receive" function of stakingManager is not called, this is what sponsor commented in the sponsor review phase:
"Bridging native token on Hyperliquid from Core to EVM is not a bridging transfer, it will directory adjust balance to the receive account(current impl)"


[04/27/2025 15:25] mrudenko
But confirm withdrawal function should fail anyway, because value of balance of staking manager will be no more than buffer size, so it’s impossible to withdraw from it


[04/27/2025 18:13] chibibridge
And that's not true.. I can confirm. It calls receive() instead, with 30k fixed gas for native token (HYPE) and 200k gas for other spot tokens


[04/27/2025 18:20] chibibridge
For example, this is a system tx (bridging tx) with the gas is set to 0x7530 (30000) - it's a transaction with hardcoded gas
```sh
$ export ETH_RPC_URL=https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm
$ cast rpc eth_getSystemTxsByBlockNumber 0x2eb819
[{"type":"0x0","chainId":"0x3e7","nonce":"0x25262","gasPrice":"0x0","gas":"0x7530","to":"0x4eea9547a69cde41a4665fe21bf94ecf1799bc09","value":"0xf6621cebc53e400","input":"0x",...,"blockHash":"0x638a11ab4bdd52c71d0108faba761594cb75caaa9b41399b6a9cca986ace2574","blockNumber":"0x2eb819","transactionIndex":"0x0",}, ...]
```

[04/28/2025 02:39] chibibridge
Regarding this, it was F-52; if it's is not fixed then the protocol is guaranteed to brick after the first deployment..


[04/28/2025 03:33] 0xpiken
Agree. Bridging HYPE from HyperCore to HyperEVM doesn't trigger receive() function. I have tried `L1Write#sendSpot()` to bridge HYPE on testnet. No other HYPE transferring transaction was created while the balance on EVM increased.


[04/28/2025 04:41] chibibridge
It's not shown as transactions in block, but visible via separate RPC call for the corresponding (next) block https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1357825202360418534/1366116869123346432

How is issue  S-1101 a duplicate of F-42


[04/28/2025 16:29] marchev
This is actually incorrect.

Bridging from L1 to L2 via `L1Write.sendCWithdrawal()` does not trigger `receive()`. Funds are debited to the address internally by the DLT *without* calling the `receive()` function.

I had the same lead during the contest and PoC'ed it. `receive()` doesn't get triggered when funds get bridged from L1 to L2.


[04/28/2025 16:33] marchev
You could try it yourself if you want to. Here's a dummy contract that I used: https://gist.github.com/marchev/e3e5961b46cd83f8627877a7a543953a

I send some HYPE to it, called `sendToL1()` and then called `withdrawFromL1()` a couple of times.

These are the raw events logged: https://gist.github.com/marchev/955f4b58b1ddf776c6342dba42c72035

As you could see the `FundsReceived()` event (topic sig = `0x363f315f930a17d1266b86a20d6dd34b1cfbc5a9db9f13a65d06a689c3a2af8a`) gets emitted only once - when I initially sent HYPE to the contract. The rest of the events emitted are only `FundsSentToL1` (`0x2f0ee555dd7d67b0db08b982b98eb2e27b97ac8d095b4e6df3463c0ba24456a8`) and `FundsWithdrawnFromL1` (`0xfb458abb5739063ac2bcec06d804af3322a68d69d66a0886080f566922c54c0c`).

Yup, atleast according to the testnet interaction.


[04/28/2025 17:21] chibibridge
sendSpot to 0x222..22 will trigger receive() with 30k gas in the next evm block as system txs


[04/28/2025 17:21] marchev
Started a thread.


[04/28/2025 18:08] rouhsamad
Even in hyper channel there are different opinions from admins. i guess if you have tested and it triggers receive(), then thats the case


[04/28/2025 19:08] marchev
Could you please share the contract source + txn hash?

For some reason, I could not get it to bridge any HYPE from L1 to L2 on testnet.

and now it shows as PJQA phase while it marked as invalid..🙁 ok


[04/29/2025 17:42] samueltroydomi
I have a question and this is not a from an annoyed or angered stance - but i have 4 medium valid findings that have been marked as valid - but all downgraded to low. I dont understand why they are downgraded to low because they involve loss of funds or incorrect transfer amounts which will lose value for the protocol or for the user in each scenario ? Is there any reason why they are downgraded to low even though they result is loss of funds for user and protocol ? Im just looking for context , thank you. Also, if they are all kept as doengraded to low, are they eligible for rewards or no?


[04/29/2025 17:43] laquica6728
No rewards for that bro


[04/29/2025 17:43] riceee8969
I still do not understand how S-854 is not duplicate of  F-31, the validators comment on the report genuinely makes no sense to me.

Moreover S-1051 has no even been judged in the judging phase.


[04/29/2025 17:46] riceee8969
~~S-872 is wrongly duped too 🙂 it talks about a completely different issue than `receive` getting triggered on transfer from core.~~

Edit: The root cause of this issue is also the same issue due to core -> evm calls triggering `recieve` but results in out of gas so the funds get frozen in they system contract and never reach the EVM contract.

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/29/2025 17:53] riceee8969
Also why is F-18 a medium issue can someone explain it  to me? 

I marked it as Low because the admins can use `queueL1Opeartions `to process the validator redelegation as the amount is present in staking account. So will not lead to any kind of DoS only the `processValidatorRedelegation `functionality is nerfed? So why is it considered a medium issue? if there is no loss of funds or any obstruction in the flow of  protocol?

It'd be great if live judging are applied to this contest as well, could you consider it?


[04/29/2025 19:27] chibibridge
F-52, F-245, F-34 should be valid for the following reason:
- F-52: validated in this channel https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1366686744753340466/1366688345484165161
- S-28: afaik no other reports are mentioning that unstaking will be silently omitted in hypercore if there are already 5 entries (if there are any feel free to merge the reports)
  - This is not F-245
- S-95: It's DoS due to array delete, which also occurs with small batchSize - the final entries in the queue cannot be processed due to the delete.


[04/29/2025 21:10] laquica6728

[04/30/2025 12:58] chibibridge
- F-52 and S-1051 seems to point the same issue.
- F-280 might be duplicate with other receive()-related issues in root-cause wise, but the problem is their root cause analysis and suggestions to fix is rough or wrong. But I think F-280 can be grouped with other issues if appropriate.

{Reactions}

[04/30/2025 13:25] chibibridge
(Apologies for the repeated mention)
Also although S-28 is marked as a duplicate of F-245, it's actually a distinct issue and should be addressed separately; I understand that it's not documented in the HL docs, but I confirmed its presence by running the PoC. More than 5 withdrawals in withdrawal queue will be silently omitted by HyperCore, which seems like a problem.

[04/30/2025 13:47] riceee8969
Also just pointing it out, for `F-278` although everyone (including me) points out the root cause that `receive` is triggered on transferring funds from core -> evm. Only `F-280`&  to an extent `S-545` clearly asses the impact of the 30k gas limit resulting in the call failing due to `stake` inside the `receive` and resulting in frozen/lost funds withing the system contract. There wont be any auto-staking.

About the issue S-358 (https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-04-kinetiq/submissions/S-358)
The `L1Write::sendSpot` function is defined as follows:

```solidity
function sendSpot(address destination, uint64 token, uint64 _wei) external {
  emit SpotSend(msg.sender, destination, token, _wei);
}
```

According to the official documentation (https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers#transferring-between-core-and-evm):

> *Transferring tokens from HyperCore to HyperEVM can be done using a `spotSend` action (or via the frontend) with the corresponding **system address** as the `destination`.*

However, in the `StakingManager::withdrawTokenFromSpot()` function, the `destination` parameter passed to `L1Write::sendSpot()` is incorrectly set to the `treasury` address instead of the **corresponding system address** for the withdrawal token.

Because of this, the issue is valid and should **not** be marked as a duplicate of issue `S-440`.


[04/30/2025 15:17] riceee8969
here the team is just sending the other L1 tokens that are sent to the spot balance of the contract to the treasure spot balance on the core side. Hence theres no issue here, they are not trying to withdraw it to EVM side. `spotSend` is basically used for transferring spot balances between addresses, and to send a `token` from core to evm we have to enter the system contract of that token as the destination in `spotSend`. I think this is where you are confused.

[04/30/2025 15:20] chibibridge
Even if it sends spot balance to hypercore in `treasury` address, it can still manage the received asset e.g., can send to evm by sending sendSpot() request from `treasury`; sponsor said it's a multisig wallet, so as long as it has capability to send arbitrary transaction, it's not lost.
